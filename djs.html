    <h3>Randy Watson</h3>
    <p>
        Well, first off "Randy Watson" is not my real name....this alias comes from one of Eddie Murphy's characters in "Coming to America."
        All my fellow children of the '80s probably already picked up on that....and if you don't know, check out the movie-- it's a classic!
        I got my start in 2006 when Dam-Funk gave me the opportunity to be part of his weekly residency (along with Laroj, Billy Goods, Matt Respect & Eddy Funkster).
        We've got a nice collective here in L.A. called Funkmosphere-- nothin' but top-shelf '80s funk/boogie and modern soul. Definitely check us out if you're not hip to this genre....I guarantee you've never heard anything like it!
